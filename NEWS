--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.5 (2005-08-12)

   * Fixed gcc 3.4.4 compilation errors

   * small changes to fix some warnings compiling with diet-glibc 0.27

   * data written to disk is now saved in the directory `/var/log/c5c/'
     where `c5c' is the `LOGGING_GROUP' defined in `config.h'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.4 (2004-01-04)

   * Maintenance release.

     Configuration updates to support the new features of automake 1.8.
     Now autoconf 2.58 or better is required.

   * Speedup optimizations.

   * Minor fixed in the top `./Makefile.am'.

   * Added `--enable-gcc-profile' in the `configure' script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.3 (2003-11-08)

   * Maintenance release.

     Fix to avoid warnings displayed by autoconf 2.58 for the obsolete macro
     `AC_HELP_STRING'.  The `AS_HELP_STRING' is now used instead.

     Updates and minor bugfixes in the RPM specfile `./c5c.spec.in' and in the
     top `./Makefile.am'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.2 (2003-09-04)

   * Fixed some cross-compiling problems.

   * Configuration files updated.

     The `CFLAGS' variable is not overwritten by the `configure' script and so
     can be used to force some compiler flags fixed at `configure'-time.
     For instance

        CFLAGS="-march=pentium -O3" ./configure

     force the compiler to generate code for the Intel Pentium CPU and
     set optimisation level to 3.

     This feature is mandatory to create generic RPM/SRPM packages
     (ex. packages for a generic `i586' architecture built on a `i686' host).

   * Added the `dist-rpm' target to the top level Makefile to automatically
     generate the RPM and SRPM packages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.1 (2003-09-02)

   * Added some optimizations in the `./src/md5.c' functions `bytes_encode',
     and `bytes_decode' for little-endian architectures.

   * General crypt code reorganization:
        md5.*           -->  md5 algorithm
        libcrypt.*      -->  cisco IOS/PIX MD5 crypt API (pseudo-library)
        crypt.*         -->  cracking tool
                             (libcrypt calls, warnings/errors management, ui)
        regex.*         -->  regular expression stuff (include DFA to explode
                             the regex into the corresponding lists of
                             characters)

   * Add GCC stack-smashing protector support in `configure.ac' (see the macro
     `cc_TRY_CFLAGS_SSP' defined in `./conf/cflags.m4').
     See also

        <http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/>

     for more informations.

   * Major changes in the code used to parse the regular expressions and the
     restore file.  Restore file format modified.

   * Bugfixes.

   * Documentation updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.0 (2003-08-13)

   * Major updates to Makefiles and `configure.ac' to support sparc-sun-solaris
     architectures and non-Linux architectures in general.
     This should fix the reported build problems on all non-glibc systems.

     Add checks for `-lsocket' and `fork' in `configure.ac'.

     The file `./src/missing/strchr.c' has been removed and its code transformed
     into a preprocessor directive.

     The file `./config/getopt_long.m4' has been removed and the code to check
     for the GNU function `getopt_long' availability in `configure.ac' has been
     simplified.

     Code cleanups, updates and enhancements in `configure.ac'.

     All the obsolete and deprecated autoconf and automake macros have been
     removed and the new available constructs have been used instead.

     Major updates/changes in near all the m4 macros (`./autotools/' folder).

   * Cleanup compiler warnings generated by gcc 3.3.

   * Code optimizations (architecture-dependant) in the function `md5_final'
     (file `./src/md5.c').

   * Fix in `./src/md5.c' to support bigendian architectures when the directive
     `SHORT_PASSWORDS' is disabled.

   * Security fix.
     Added a check in `./src/session.c' for the `RESTORE_FILE' and `SCORE_FILE'
     format, not to overwrite user/system files via symlink attacks.

   * Code cleanups and many minor bugfixes.

     The code related to the `MD5_SIZE_OVER_SPEED' directive in the function
     `md5_transform()' in the file `md5.c' copyright by
     Erik Andersen <andersen@uclibc.org> has been removed.

     The code (and its legalese copyright) in the file `md5.c' derived from the
     RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm has been removed.
     The code written by Colin Plumb in 1993 is now used instead.
     No copyright is claimed and the code is in the public domain.

   * Full functional porting on Solaris SPARC stations (`sparc-sun-solaris2.8').
     Should now compile/work on most Un*x systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.4 (2003-06-17)

   * Some code optimizations in the function `md5_transform()', implemented in
     the file `md5.c' (probably they are little-endian dependant...).
     Anyway, cracking speed seems to have been increased by +8,5%.

   * `configure-ac' and *.m4 scripts have been updated to use the new macros
     `AC_RUN_IFELSE', `AC_COMPILE_IFELSE' defined in autoconf 2.57.

   * A check about the gcc multiple implicit struct copy bug has been added
     (see the macro `cc_GCC_MISC_BUG', in the folder `./m4/gcc_bugs.m4').
     It just prints a warning message if the bug is detected.

   * Added `./src/missing/malloc.c' for the systems with a `malloc' function not
     compatible with the GNU C library `malloc' (i.e., where `malloc (0)' does
     not returns a valid pointer).

   * Some code cleanups in `./configure.ac' to speed up the configuration step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.3 (2003-05-22)

   * The functions `md5_pad', `md5_encode', and `md5_decode' implemented in the
     source file `./src/md5.c' have been merged directly into the function
     `md5_final' to increase a bit the code speed.

   * The function `F(x,y,z)' of the MD5 algorithm (see RFC 1321) is a little bit
     optimized (as found in Colin Plumbs public domain implementation).

   * Add `c5c.spec' to generate the RPM and RPMS packages from the tarball,
     entering the command:
        `rpm -ba --target i686-pc-linux-gnu c5c.spec'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.2 (2003-05-11)

   * Add the `atexit.c' file in the folder `./src/missing' and all the related
     stuff in `./src/missing/Makefile.ac' ac `./configure.ac'.

   * Functions `chmod' (`chmod(SCORE_FILE, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR)') removed in the
     module `decrypt.c'.  Added `umask' for the same security purpose.

   * Add the file `README' in the folder `dictionary' found on the WEB.
     The file is the original one written by `Luigi M. Bianchi'
     <lbianchi@sol.yorku.ca> who wrote the italian dictionary included
     in the package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.1 (2003-03-23)

   * Introduced the check of the `chmod' function availability
     (see `#define HAVE_CHMOD' in `configure.ac').
     Used in the `decrypt.c' to enforce data security.

     Old check :
        #if defined __USE_BSD || defined __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED
     removed from `decrypt.c'.

   * The ANSI mode compiler mode has been turned active by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.0 (2003-03-15)

   * The check for inconsistences in the options entered by the user has been
     rewritten.  Now the options can be entered in any order.

   * New syntax for bruteforce strictly based on regular expressions.

       regexpr           means
       ------------------------------------------------------
       [a-z]             abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
       [a-i0-4]          abcdefghi01234
       .                 `ALPHABET_ALL'
       [:lower:]         [a-z]
       [:upper:]         [A-Z]
       [:alpha:]         [A-Za-z]
       [:alnum:]         [A-Za-z0-9]
       [:digit:]         [0-9]
       [:all:]           `ALPHABET_ALL'
       [a-z]{n}          [a-z] repeated exactly `n' times
       [[:upper:]0-9]    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
       [^[0-9]]          `ALPHABET_ALL' - [0-9]

   * Added the flag `--enable-gcc-ansi' in the `configure' script.
     The `-ansi' flag for GCC is turned off by default.

   * The `SCORE_FILE' is set in read-write mode only for the owner of the c5c
     process.  This works only if gcc is not called with the `-ansi' flag.

   * Bugfix in the format of the error message displayed by the dfa error
     manager and minor bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.2 (2003-02-24)

   * Note: next release will be the version 1.0.

   * Added all the needed checks for the included header files, as recommended
     by the autoconf documentation.  So now it should be possible to compile c5c
     with no/minor problems on most Unixes.

   * The wordlist attack can be finally stopped and restored with the `-r'
     option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.1 (2003-02-21)

   * Added the option `--daemonize' to run in daemon mode the program.
     If it is killed (by: kill <pid>), the session status is saved on the text
     file `./restore_cc' (see `#define RESTORE_FILE' in `params.h'), as usual.
     The session can be restored later using the `-r' option.

     When the cracking session finish, the result is saved in the the text file
     `./score_cc' (see `#define SCORE_FILE` in `params.h').

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.0 (2003-02-20)

   * Added support for Cisco PIX encrypted password.
      ex.1  passwd WT.PMwgB2ek6zyV3 encrypted
      ex.2  enable password 2KFQnbNIdI.2KYOU encrypted

Thanks to mao <mao@oxid.it> and Michael Thumann <mthumann@ernw.de> for the
     support found at <http://www.oxid.it>.

   * EGD support has been enabled by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.8.2 (2003-02-10)

   * Added support to EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) socket and protocol.
     Should be used only where the OS is not Linux, and/or `/dev/random' is not
     available :(.
     You can download the Perl script by Brian Warner <warner@lothar.com> at
     <http://sourceforge.net/projects/egd/>.

     To enable the EGD support run

        `./configure --enable-egd-support'

     Note that it is disabled by default.
     The socket must be created in `EGD_SOCKET_PATH' (defined in the `./config.h'
     file, automatically created by the `./configure' script), currently set to

         `/tmp/entropy'

     (can be manually modified).

     Added the user options and the corresponding help messages

         `-e, --egd', `-d, --dev-random', `-y, --sys-rand'

   * Some minor bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.8.1 (2003-02-02)

   * Porting to Win32 platforms, using the Cygnus Developer's Kit.
     See at <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>.

   * New code to automagically detect the processor family (used by the compiler
     for optimization purposes).  Now it should handle correctly all PC cpus.
     Added support for the Cygwin environment.

   * Added option `--disable-dev-random' in `configure.ac' to disable the use
     of (the linux device) `/dev/random'.
     If selected, the ANSI functions `srand' and `rand' are used instead.

   * Fix some gcc 3.2 minor warnings.
     Fix in ./src/include/cc_getopt.h to correctly handle GNU `getopt_long()'.

   * Tarball rebuilt using autoconf-2.57 and automake-1.7.2.
     Introduced some little changes in the file parsed by the GNU autotools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.8.0 (2003-01-26)

   * Added the pause/resume feature (`-r' or `--resume' user option).

   * Added code to implement a simple garbage collection system to avoid
     memory leaks bugs, expecially when a fatal error occurs at runtime.
     All the heap memory dinamically allocated by the program is now getting
     freed when the program ends.

   * Password scheme parser completely rewritten and simplified, using a DFA.
     The sintax has been modified to make unambiguous the grammar, using one
     lookahead symbol.

   * The user can now define lists of consecutive chars in the regular
     expressions associated with the `b' option.  For instance, the expression

        `[@\-L1sTa-d\\]'

     can be used to specify the list of chars

        `@-L1sTabcd\'

     The escape sequence `\-' maps the minus (`-') char.

   * Added a check to see if the strings to crypt have only legal letters for
     the IOS charset.

   * Several minor bugs and a segmentation fault fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.7.1 (2002-01-01)

   * User options modified to unify the options `-a', `-A', and `-b'.
     The option -w (or `--dictionary') has been added to permit an attack based
     on a given vocabulary.
     The option `-v' (or `--verbose') has been introduced.  Can be used several
     times to increase the number of informations in the output messages.
     The option `-L' (or `--license') has been introduced.

   * The support for GNU `getopt_long()' (i.e. long options, like `--help')
     has been added, even on platforms where there is no such a function in the
     local C libraries (using the `configure' features).

     The `./configure' script has been improved:

      - new options `--enable-gcc-warnings' and `--disable-extraspeed' added

      - automatic check for compilers flags to produce code optimized in speed
        (supported processors: ix86, Kx, and athlon); partially gcc only

      - some fix to support the compilers that don't know the '-ansi' flag and
        the `DISABLE_MAX_SPEED' directive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.7.0

   * The package is now GNUlitically correct:  configure, Makefile, config.h
     files has been created with the GNU tools aclocal, autoconf, autoheader,
     and automake.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.4

   * The new sintax introduced is now a bit more compliant with the common
     sintax used by the regular expressions.

     Thanks to Silvan Calarco for this report.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.3 (bugfix release)

   * The following input:

           `-Ac,[@#],,,e

     was incorrectly rejected with an error message, because the char `,'
     inside a password structure was not interpreted as a fix character.

     A pseudo regular sintax for the options `-a' and `-A' has been introduced.

     Thanks to Silvan Calarco for this report.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.2 (bugfix release)

   * The bash tty is no more in a broken state when the program is stopped by
     the break sequence (^C).  The functions `ttyinit()', `ttydone()' have been
     added for this purpose.  Thanks to Silvan Calarco for this bug report.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.1 (bugfix release)

   * Fix the `segmentation fault' error that occurred sometimes when trying to
     decrypt a password using the brute force method.
     Was a malloc allocation with wrong size in the function `bruteforce()'.

   * A couple of buffer overruns have been fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.6.0

   * Command parser mostly rewritten.

   * The wrong command line inputs now are correctly managed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.5.1

   * Added support for user defined alphabets (options `-a', and `-A').

   * General code improvements and several minor bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Noteworthy changes in version 0.5.0

   * First partially usable release of the program.

   * Added some code optimizations (see `ENABLE_MAX_SPEED' directive)
     for password with length less than sixteen characters.

   * Lots of tests made using

      - a Cisco 2500 router with IOS C2500-JS-L, Version 11.2(4)
        (c2500-js-l.112-4.bin),

      - a Cisco 2620 router with IOS C2600-IS-M, Version 12.2(8)
        (c2600-is-mz.122-8.bin).
