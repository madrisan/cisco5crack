You can find the EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) software and documentation
looking at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/egd/>.
The EGD Daemon has been written by Brian Warner <warner@lothar.com>.

cisco5crack is able to read the entropy collected by the EGD daemon, using the
socket interface provided by EGD.  I've tested only EGD v0.9.

Note that on Linux systems the device `/dev/urandom' offers a better source
of randomness and that cisco5crack can also read from such a device.
