1. Summary 
   
   The encryption algorithm used by Cisco PIX Firewall software to encrypt 
   passwords for "enable" and "passwd" commands is very fast...too fast. 
   An off-line password guessing attack could be really effective against 
   this kind of passwords. 


2. Systems Affected 

   Cisco PIX Firewalls (all models and all versions) 


3. Details 

   Cisco PIX passwords are limited to a length of 16 Bytes, so in theory 
   there are 255^16 possible passwords, but in real life there are about 
   80^16 useful password combinations, take a look at your keyboard to 
   verify, even if strong passwords are used. 

   Cisco's password encryption is based on base64 encoded MD5 hashes. 
   Routers IOS uses 1000 MD5 Update rounds to make password brute forcing 
   attacks harder, but the PIX firewall uses only one MD5 update and then the 
   digest is base64 encoded. 
 
   For base64 encoding Cisco uses the _crypt_to64() Function of the FreeBSD 
   libcrypt library. 

   Here's the code to compute PIX password hashes: 

========================================================== 
         
   MD5Context ctx1; 
   unsigned char final[MD5_SIZE+1]; 
   unsigned char cleartext [16+1]; 
   unsigned char cisco_encoded [16+1]; 

   memset(cisco_encoded,0,sizeof(cisco_encoded)); 
   memset(cleartext,0,sizeof(cleartext)); 
   strcpy((char*) cleartext,"test"); 

   MD5Init2(&ctx1); 
   MD5Update2(&ctx1,(unsigned char*) cleartext,16); 
   MD5Final2(final,&ctx1); 

   char* p = (char*) cisco_encoded; 
   _crypt_to64(p,*(unsigned long*) (final+0),4); p += 4; 
   _crypt_to64(p,*(unsigned long*) (final+4),4); p += 4; 
   _crypt_to64(p,*(unsigned long*) (final+8),4); p += 4; 
   _crypt_to64(p,*(unsigned long*) (final+12),4); p += 4; 

========================================================== 

   Due to some weaknesses in the MD5 hash algorithm (den Boer and Bosselaers 
   found a so called pseudo-collision) there may be more effective attacks in 
   the future. 


4. Impact 

   PIX Firewalls are security devices principally used for perimeter security. 
   Once gained access to the Firewall by mean of a valid enable password an 
   intruder could modify its configuration as wanted. 
   In this situation all networks and resources protected by the 
   Firewall could be affected. 

   Another important impact is due to the ability of recent version of 
   PIX Firewalls softwares (new feature in version 6.2) to sniff traffic. 
   The "capture" command could be used by an intruder to perform a 
   sniffing of remote traffic based on pre-configured ACLs. 


5. Solution 
 
   Ask Cisco to use a stronger password scrambler (at least as the one 
   ALREADY used on their routers and switches). 
   While Cisco doesn't change the encryption algorithm for the PIX we 
   recommend using strong passwords with the full length of 16 bytes. 
 

6. Available Password Crackers 

   Cain & Abel (www.oxid.it)  from version 2.5 beta13 it includes both 
   crackers for Cisco PIX and Routers password hashes. 
   The keyrate of those crackers shows the speed and feasibility of an 
   off-line password guessing attacks. 
 
   Too many secrets (www.ernw.de) 
   Version 0.9 includes password attacks (brute forcing, dictionary 
   and hybrid attacks) for Cisco routers and the Cisco PIX firewall 


7. Conclusions 
 
   The feasibility of an off-line password guessing is something that every 
   network administrator should consider before leaving PIX configuration 
   files on TFTP servers, sending them unencrypted via email or using telnet 
   for configuring the PIX.
