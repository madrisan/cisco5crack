[done] New sintax strictly based on the regular expression sintax
       (subset of the regular expression sintax)

         regexpr           means                             status
         -----------------------------------------------------------
         [a-z]             abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz        done
         [a-i0-4]          abcdefghi01234                    done
         .                 ALPHABET_FULL (1)                 done
         [:lower:]         [a-z]                             done
         [:upper:]         [A-Z]                             done
         [:alpha:]         [A-Za-z]                          done
         [:alnum:]         [A-Za-z0-9]                       done
         [:digit:]         [0-9]                             done
         [:all:]           ALPHABET_FULL                     done
         [a-z]{n}          [a-z] repeated exactly n times    done
         [[:upper:]0-9]                                      done
         [^[0-9]]          ALPHABET_FULL - [0-9]             done

         [a-z]{n,}         [a-z] repeated n or more times    unsupported
         [a-z]{n,m}        [a-z] repeated at least n times,  unsupported
                                 but not more than m times
         * + ? ^ $                                           unsupported

       (1) `ALPHABET_FULL' is the concatenation of the strings:
              " !"#$%&'()*+,-./"
              "0123456789"
              ":;<=>@"
              "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
               "[\]^_`"
              "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
              "{|}~"

           Note that the characters
              .[\]{}-
           have special meanings, so they must be escaped to be used as plain
           characters.  For instance `\[' is the open square bracket, not the
           start character of a charset block as in `[:digit:]'.

[done] Sane all the FIXME present in the source files
         (grep -i FIXME `find ./src -name *.c -type f`)
       and in `autoconf.ac'.
[done] Add more infos in the file `score_cc' in case of failure.
[done] Support the `^C' and `resume' actions in the `wordlist' cracking mode.
[done] Make possible to execute c5c in background.
[done] Check the implementation of the Cisco PIX encrypted passwords support.
[done] Add support for Cisco PIX encrypted passwords.
[done] Add support for EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) randomness source
       (non Linux systems).
[done] Do the little changes needed for the porting to Cygwin environment on
       Windows platforms.
[done] Reorganize the functions in the source files.
[done] Add a pause/resume feature for long cracking sessions.
       Should save the session data to a text file (need a bison parser (?)).
[done] Implement a garbage collection system.
[done] Rewrite the regular expression parser using a dfa (or flex (?)).
[done] Check how the IOS manage the extended ASCII character set.
[done] Unify the options `-b', `a', and `-A'.
[done] Make some extensions in the sintax of the user options `-a' and `-A'.
[done] Add support for GNU `getopt_long()'.
[done] Add a scan engine based on an external dictionary (`-w' option).


# Other things to do, before the versions 1.1.0 (ordered list)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[done] Add an automatic check in the `configure' script using the predefined
       macro `AC_C_BIGENDIAN' (`WORDS_BIGENDIAN' will be defined in case of
       a detected big-endian architecture).
[done] Add support for big-endian architectures.
[done] Check the format of `restore_cc' and `score_cc' to avoid the overwrite of
       user/system files via a symlink attack (security fix).
[done] Found an italian dictionary with less entries.


# Some other ideas
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[****] Due to some weaknesses in the MD5 hash algorithm (den Boer and Bosselaers
       found a so called pseudo-collision) there may be more effective attacks
       in the future.  Investigation needed...
[****] Implement the 'time-memory trade-off' technique to crack PIX passwords.
       See at <http://lasecpc13.epfl.ch/pub/lasec/doc/Oech03.pdf>

[ ?? ] Convert the parser engine to a `GNU bison' y-file
        or
       Save the restore file in XML format so that it can be parsed by libxml2.

[ ?? ] Add dictionary variations (i.e. a -> @, pswd -> dwsp)
        - fixed rules
        - user defined rules
