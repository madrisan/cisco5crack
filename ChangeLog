Changes in version 1.1.5

* gcc 3.4.3 warnings fixed

* changed email address and pgp/gpg public key; updated copyright lines

* data written to disk is now saved in the directory `/var/log/c5c/'
     drwxr-x---  2 root c5c 72 2004-12-18 18:49 /var/log/c5c/
  where `c5c' is the `LOGGING_GROUP' defined in `config.h'

* small changes to fix some warnings compiling with diet-glibc 0.27

* gcc 3.4.4 compilation errors fixed

* updated README

* fixed syntax error in config/cflags.m4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.4

* Rebuild with automake 1.8
  - ./config/mkinstalldirs: removed (now obsolete)
  - ./config/bootstrap.sh: added `--Wobsolete' and `--Woverride' options
  - refresh autoconf script to use autoconf 2.58 or better

* Various code and memory optimizations to speed execution.

* Minor fixes in `./Makefile.am'.

* Added `--enable-gcc-profile' in the `configure' script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.3

* Fix to avoid warnings displayed by autoconf 2.58 for the obsolete macro
  `AC_HELP_STRING'.  The `AS_HELP_STRING' is now used instead.

* Updates in the RPM specfile `./c5c.spec.in' and `./Makefile.am'.

* Minor fixes in `./Makefile.am'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.2

* Fixed all the cross compiling warnings

     "AC_RUN_IFELSE called without default to allow cross compiling"

  displayed running autoconf with the `--warnings=all' option.

* Removed the obsolete macro `AC_PROG_CC_STDC' from `configure.ac'.

* The `CFLAGS' variable is not overwritten by the `configure' script and so
  can be used to force some compiler flags fixed at `configure'-time.
  For instance

     CFLAGS="-march=pentium -O3" ./configure

  force the compiler to generate code for the Intel Pentium CPU and set
  optimisation level to 3.

  This feature can be interesting when creating generic RPM/SRPM packages
  (ex. packages for a generic `i386' architecture built on a `i686' host).

* Added the `dist-rpm' target to the top level Makefile to automatically
  generate the RPM and SRPM packages.

* Fixed portability problems in the RPM generation via Makefile.
  Now 'rpm --eval=%{_sourcedir}' and similar commands are used instead of
  fixed defined paths.  Tested on SuSE and QiLinux distros.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.1pre1 - 1.1.1pre3, 1.1.1

* Added some optimizations in the `./src/md5.c' functions `bytes_encode', and
  `bytes_decode' for little-endian architectures only.

* General crypt-related code reorganization:
     md5.*           -->  md5 algorithm
     libcrypt.*      -->  cisco IOS/PIX MD5 crypt API (pseudo-library)
     crypt.*         -->  cracking tool
                          (libcrypt calls, warnings/errors management, ui)

  List of the renamed/moved source and header files:
     `./src/option.c'             --> `./src/main.c'
     `./src/include/option.h'     --> `./src/include/main.h'
     `./src/crypt.c'              --> `./src/libcrypt.c'
     `./src/include/crypt.h'      --> `./src/include/libcrypt.h'
     `./src/crypt_fe.c'           --> `./src/crypt.c'
     `./src/include/crypt_fe.h'   --> `./src/include/crypt.h'

  All the #define MD5_* lines moved from
     `./src/include/params.h' (global def)
  to
     `./src/include/libcrypt.h' (crypt/decrypt def);

  Unneded preprocessor directive
     `#include "params.h"'
  removed from
     `./src/include/libcrypt.h'.

  End of `./src/libcrypt.c' code separation from `entropy.c' and `tty.c'.

  Functions `cisco_is_plaintext()', and `cisco_is_salt()' moved from
  `./src/decrypt.c' to `./src/libcrypt.c'.

  Regular expressions related stuff moved to the new files `./src/regex.c'
  and `./src/include/regex.h'.

* Add GCC stack-smashing protector support in `configure.ac' (see the macro
  `cc_TRY_CFLAGS_SSP' defined in `./conf/cflags.m4').
  See also
     <http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/>
  for more informations.

* DFA for regular expressions scorporated from the general DFA (`./src/dfa.c').
  Code moved to `./src/regex.c'.

  Fixed an alignment problem of the character `^' in some DFA outputs.

     ** ERROR: buggy regular expression
     [^^[:digit:][:lower:]]x[abc\\\_][0-9]{2}f
        ^ expected token `['

     ( ^ expected token `['                      <-- correct position )

* New format for the restore files (`restore_cc').
  DFA modified to make it able to cut the new restore files into the right
  sequence of tokens.

  Fixed alignment problems in the DFA while parsing a sintatically buggy
  restore files (`./restore_cc').  DFA code moved to `./src/session.c'.
  Files `./src/dfa.c', `./src/include/dfa.h' removed.

     ** ERROR: parser fatal error
     _method_"bruteforce"

          ^ string exceed static size limit

* Fix: the restore file is not deleted right after the parsing, but only when
  all the checks of its content are performed (see: `./src/decrypt.c').

* `configure.ac': raised version number to 1.0.

* Documentation updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.0-pre1 - 1.1.0-pre10, 1.1.0-rc1

* Function `md5_update()' modified to work on sparks (bigendian architecture).

* Code optimizations (architecture-dependant) in the function `md5_final'
  (file `./src/md5.c').

* Add optimization support in `configure.ac' for sparc-sun-solaris + GNU gcc
  architectures (thanks to Luca Trombotto for the a wonderful ssh access to his
  SunOS frodo 5.8 Generic_108528-21 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-5 Solaris).

* Fix a visualization problem in the `configure' script when optimization
  flags for the compiler are not found.

* Fix in `./src/md5.c' to support bigendian architectures when the directive
  `SHORT_PASSWORDS' is disabled.

* Cleanup compiler warnings generated by gcc 3.3.

* Make `./m4/devices.m4', `./m4/getopt_long.m4', and `gcc_bugs.m4' work again.
  Was a bug introduced in the release 1.0.4 by using `AC_RUN_IFELSE' in a wrong
  way.

* Add a check for `-lsocket' in `configure.ac' (needed by SUN Solaris).

* Bugfix in `./m4/getopt_long.m4'. Now the `./src/missing' version of
  `getopt_long' should be selected when this function is not found in the system
  libraries.

* More code cleanups in `configure.ac'.

* Add checks for `fork' availability in `configure.ac'.
  The `--daemonize' option is now disabled if a working `fork' function is not
  detected.

* The file `./src/missing/strchr.c' has been removed and its code transformed
  into a preprocessor directive inserted in the source files when needed.

* The file `./m4/getopt_long.m4' has been removed and the code to check for the
  GNU function `getopt_long' availability has been simplified.

* Various fixes in the Makefiles to let `configure' compile and link the
  `./src/missing/.' functions that are not implemented in the system libraries.
  Now a static library is created to accomplish this task.
  This should fix the reported build problems on non-glibc systems.

* The Linux RPM `spec' file have been converted to a `spec.in' file to be
  processed by make in order to automatically update the program name, its
  version number, and the bug-report-address.

* Add the `dist-update' tag to `./Makefile.am' to automatically generate
     `./FILES.md5sum'
     `./c5c.spec' (from `./c5c.spec.in')
  using the command `make dist-update'.

  Add the `dictionary-it' tag to `./dictionary/Makefile.am' to generate a
  tarball with the italian vocabulary.

  The dictionary files have been stripped out of the main package tarball and
  now are distributed as separate archives.

* Trivial update in `configure.ac' to generate also a tar.bz2 package.

* Add checks in `configure.ac' for `struct sockaddr_un.sun_path' availability,
  needed to compile successfully the EGD support.

* Security fix.  Added a check in `./src/session.c' for the
     `RESTORE_FILE' and `SCORE_FILE'
  format, not to overwrite user/system files via a symlink attacks.

* `./m4' folder moved to `./config'.

* The macros in `./config/devices.m4' has been modified to avoid C code
  duplication.  See the new macro `_cc_HAVE_DEV'.

* Add the shell script `./config/bootstrap.sh' for packet management purposes.

* The folder `./scripts' has been removed and its content moved to the `./config'
  folder.  Makefiles and `configure.ac' updated.

* The code related to the `MD5_SIZE_OVER_SPEED' directive in the function
  `md5transform()' in the file `md5.c' copyright by
  Erik Andersen <andersen@uclibc.org> has been removed.

* The code (and its legalese copyright) in the file `md5.c' derived from the
  RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm has been removed.
  The code written by Colin Plumb in 1993 is now used instead.
  No copyright is claimed and the code is in the public domain.

* Fix in POSIX termios headers and functions detection via autoconf (ac macro
  `AC_SYS_POSIX_TERMIOS').

* `-O3' optimization removed from the gcc `CFLAGS'.
  O3 + gcc (GCC) 3.2.3 produce broken code on the `sparc-sun-solaris2.8'
  architecture I've used in the function `cisco_pix_crypt'.

* Added `dictionary-it-tgz' and `dictionary-it-bz2' targets for make in the
  `dictionary' folder.
  The old target `dictionary-it' is still available and points to the
  `dictionary-it-tgz' one because it compress better these particular text
  files.

* Code cleanups and many minor bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.4

* Some code optimizations in the function `md5_transform', implemented in the
  file `./src/md5.c' (probably they are little-endian dependant...).
  Anyway, cracking speed seems to have been increased by +8,5%.

* Code updates in `configure.ac' and *.m4 scripts to use the new macros
     `AC_RUN_IFELSE', `AC_COMPILE_IFELSE'
  defined in autoconf 2.57.

* Fix in the macro `cc_GCC_SR_BUG' in the folder `./m4/gcc_bugs.m4' to let it
  work again within the `AC_RUN_IFELSE' sintax.

* The code to check for the gcc `strength-reduce bug' has been moved from
  `autoconf.ac' to the file `gcc_bug.m4', in the `./m4' folder.
  A check about the gcc multiple implicit struct copy bug has been added
  (see the macr `cc_GCC_MISC_BUG', in the folder `./m4/gcc_bugs.m4').
  It just prints a warning message if the bug is detected.

* Some code cleanups in `./configure.ac' to speed up the configuration step.

* Added `./src/missing/malloc.c' for the systems with a `malloc' function not
  compatible with the GNU C library `malloc' (i.e., where `malloc (0)' does not
  returns a valid pointer).

* Added `./scripts/c5c_files' to generate the text file `./FILES' with the list
  of the c5c files and their md5sum associated values.

* Typos fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.3

* The functions `md5_pad', `md5_encode', and `md5_decode' implemented in the
  source file `./src/md5.c' have been merged directly into the function
  `md5_final' to increase the code speed.

* The function `F(x,y,z)' of the MD5 algorithm (see RFC 1321) is a little bit
  optimized (as found in Colin Plumbs public domain implementation).

* Add `c5c.spec' to generate the RPM and RPMS packages from the tarball with the
  command:  `rpm -ba --target i686-pc-linux-gnu c5c.spec'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.2

* Add the file `README' in the folder `dictionary' found on the WEB in the
  original dictionary package made by Luigi M. Bianchi <lbianchi@sol.yorku.ca>.

* Add the README.EGD file.

* Add the `atexit.c' file in the folder `./src/missing' and related stuff in
  `./src/missing/Makefile.ac' ac `./configure.ac'.

* Functions `chmod' (`chmod(SCORE_FILE, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR)') removed in the
  module `decrypt.c'.  Added `umask' for the same security purpose.

* The sentence "or (at your option) any later version." has been removed from
  all the license header in my source files.

* Typos fixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.1

* Introduced the check of the `chmod' function availability
  (see `#define HAVE_CHMOD' in `configure.ac').
  Used in the `decrypt.c' to enforce data security.

  Old check
     #if defined __USE_BSD || defined __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED
  removed from `decrypt.c'.

* The ANSI mode compiler mode has been turned active by default.

* Written a script (`./scripts/gzip2bz2') to convert `c5c-x.x.x.tar.gz' into the
  bzip2 archive `c5c-x.x.x.tar.bz2'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.0pre3 == version 1.0.0

* The check for inconsistences in the options entered by the user has been
  rewritten.  Now the options can be entered in any order!

* Bugfix in the format of the error message displayed by the dfa error manager.

* Minor bugfixes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.0pre2

* IOS silently discards space characters at the begin of a plain string to
  be hashed.  Now c5c exit with an error in such a situation.

* New syntax for bruteforce strictly based on regular expressions.

    regexpr          means
    -----------------------------------------------------
    [a-z]            abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    [a-i0-4]         abcdefghi01234
    .                `ALPHABET_ALL'
    [a-z]{n}         [a-z] repeated exactly `n' times
    [:lower:]        [a-z]
    [:upper:]        [A-Z]
    [:alpha:]        [A-Za-z]
    [:alnum:]        [A-Za-z0-9]
    [:digit:]        [0-9]
    [:all:]          `ALPHABET_ALL'
    [a-z]{n}         [a-z] repeated exactly `n' times
    [[:upper:]0-9]   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
    [^[0-9]]         `ALPHABET_ALL' - [0-9]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.0.0pre1

* Minor changes to remove two warnings when compiling in no `-ansi' mode.

* Added the flag `--enable-gcc-ansi' in the `configure' script.
  The `-ansi' flag for GCC is turned off by default.

* The `SCORE_FILE' is set in read-write mode only for the owner of the c5c
  process.  This works only if gcc is not called with the `-ansi' flag.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.9.2

* Added all the needed checks for the included header files, as recommended by
  the autoconf documentation.

* The wordlist attack can be now stopped and restored with the `-r' option.

* Bugfix -- The file `./restore_cc' (or the file specified by the user with the
  option `-r'), is removed when the restored session ends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.9.1

* Added the option `--daemonize' to run in daemon mode the program.
  If it is killed (by: kill <pid>), the session status is saved on the text
  file `./restore_cc' (see `#define RESTORE_FILE' in `params.h'), as usual.
  The session can be restored later using the `-r' option.

  When the cracking session finish, the result is saved in the the text file
  `./score_cc' (see `#define SCORE_FILE` in `params.h').

* Bugfix -- When a cracking session was killed by a `^C' character, the actual
  string used in the bruteforce test could be lost (i.e. the `chpos' counters
  _could_ point to the next string in the list of the candidates choosen by the
  user) and the next resumed session (`-r' option) would loose one test.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.9.0

* Added support for Cisco PIX encrypted password.
 Thanks to mao <mao@oxid.it> and Michael Thumann <mthumann@ernw.de> for the
  support found at <http://www.oxid.it>.

  Minor changes in the code to support this new feature. They have been checked
  with some regression tests.

  Again, some code cleanups (this time expecially in the user option parser).

* `HAVE_DEV_RANDOM' modified into `DEV_RANDOM_SUPPORT'.

* EGD support has been enabled by default (`EGD_SUPPORT').

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8.2

* More extended code cleanups.

* Fix the support for the quote (`"') character when restoring a cracking
  session.  Now the quote character must be escaped when used in a regular
  expression or alphabet (`\"').  Here an example

       c5c -b'c[\\@\_\"][a-z]:2:{:12:}e' ...

* Added support to EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) socket and protocol.
  Should be used only where the OS is not Linux, and/or `/dev/random' is not
  available :(.
  You can download the Perl script by Brian Warner <warner@lothar.com> at
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/egd/>.

* Added the user options and the corresponding help messages

       `-e, --egd', `-d, --dev-random', `-y, --sys-rand'

* Add the option `--enable-egd-support' to enable the EGD socket support
  (that is disabled by default).
  The socket must be created in `EGD_SOCKET_PATH' (defined in the `./config.h'
  file, automatically created by the `./configure' script), currently set to

       `/tmp/entropy'

  (can be manually modified).

* The `union' in the structure `options_t' has been replaced by a `struct' to
  avoid problems while setting default values (in `options.c').

* Fix a wrong `#define' in `entropy.c'.  Now `/dev/random' is used if it exists.

* Add script ./scripts/c5c_indent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8.1

* New code to automagically detect the processor family (used by the compiler
  for optimization purposes).  Now it should handle correctly all PC cpus.
  Added support for the Cygwin environment.

* Add the modules `entropy.c' and `entropy.h'.

* Add the option `--disable-dev-random' in `configure.ac' to disable the use of
  (the linux device) `/dev/random'.
  If selected, the ANSI functions `srand' and `rand' are used instead.

* Autotools scripts moved in the package subfolder ./scripts.

* Porting to Win32 platforms, using the Cygnus Developer's Kit.

  See at <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>,
         <http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/>.

* Fix some gcc 3.2 minor warnings.

* Some changes/fix in the files parsed by the GNU autotools.
  Fix in ./src/include/cc_getopt.h to correctly handle GNU `getopt_long()'.

* Fix in Makefile.am in the top source directory to include the file VERSION
  in the tarball.

* Tarball rebuilt using autoconf-2.57 and automake-1.7.2.
  Some changes in the files parsed by the GNU autotools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8rc2

* Extended code cleanups.

* Finally implemented the pause/resume (`-r' or `--resume' options) feature.

* Lots of changes in the code, especially in the dfa parser module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.8rc1

* Added code in `memory.[ch]' to implement a simple garbage collection system,
  to avoid any memory leaks problems.
  All the heap memory blocks dinamically allocated by the program are now
  getting freed when the program ends.

* Password scheme parser completely rewritten and simplified, using a DFA.
  The sintax has been modified to make it unambiguous with one lookahead symbol.

* Added support for user defined lists of consecutive chars in the regular
  expressions associated with the `b' option.
  For instance, the expression

       `[@\-L1sTa-d\\]'

  now specify the list of chars

       `@-L1sTabcd\'

  The escape sequence `\-' maps the minus (`-') char.

* Trivial change in the password scheme output, when the `-vv' option is
  specified, to make it more compact.

  Example:  `{4}*5{8}*3' is now converted into

        p[0..4] = "0123456789"
        p[5..7] = "$%&=+-_@"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7.2pre2

* Added code to check the length of passwords to be crypted.
  This fix a `segmentation fault' for input string with a length greater then
  `MAX_PLAIN_SIZE' (thanks to Silvan Calarco).

* Introduced a check to verify that the strings to crypt have only legal letters
  for the IOS charset (`IOS_CHARSET').

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7.2pre1

* Some bugfixes.

* Fix in the `configure.ac' code that manage the Athlon CPU optimization flags
  and in `./m4/getopt_long.m4' where the deprecated call to `LIBOBJ' is now
  replaced by a call to `AC_LIBOBJ'.

* Code optimizations/cleanups in functions `bruteforce()' and `md5crypt()'.

* Cleanups and changes in `configure.ac' and *.m4 files in the newborn folder
  `m4' to use (possibly all) the guide-lines found in the Autoconf bible written
  by David MacKenzie, Ben Elliston, and Akim Demaille.

* Added `params.h' with the global parameters (directives) of the program

* Added `memory.h' and `memory.c' with all the memory allocation routines.

* Added code to `configure.ac' to set the `HAVE_DEV_TTY' directive in
  `config.h' if the device `/dev/tty' exists and can be used.

* Some `unsigned long' variables used in the RSA code has been changed into
  the `u_int32_t' ISO C typedef.
  Add `AC_CHECK_TYPE(u_int32_t, unsigned int)' command in `configure.ac'

* Added loop unrolling in `md5transform()' configurable via the

         `MD5_SIZE_OVER_SPEED'

  preprocessor directive (code taken from the `uClib-libcrypt' library).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7.1pre3

* The option `-L' (or `--license') has been added.

* The option `-v' (or `--verbose') has been introduced.
  Can be used several times to increase the number of informations in the
  output messages.
  note:  the old option `-v' (or `--version') has been changed into `-V'.

* A buffer overrun have been fixed.

* Duplication of alphabets in password structures is now just a duplication of
  pointers not new memory dinamically allocated.

* User options completely modified to unify the options `-a', `-A', and `-b'.

  The options `-a' and `-A' have been removed.

  The user option

        `-b[<letters>]*<int>'

  has been introduced for analogy with the yet implemented `-b{<id>}*<int>'.

* Added options

        `--enable-gcc-warnings' and `--disable-gcc-warnings'

  to `configure.ac'.

* Code fix when the `-ansi' option is not supported by the compiler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7.1pre2

* The package tree has been completly reorganized to separate source code,
  header files, and GNU stuff

* Add full support for GNU `getopt_long()'.

  Various checks and enhancements introduced in the user options parser.

  Add code to compile the program successfully even on platforms that don't
  have `getopt_long()' (neither header file nor library locally installed).

* Fix in `configure.ac' to correctly manage the `DISABLE_MAX_SPEED' directive
  (see the files `config.h.in' and `config.h').

* The redundant prompt options `-db', `-da', `-dA', and `-dw' has been removed
  the meaning of the option `-b' has been modified.

* Added support for GNU `getopt_long()' in `configure.ac'.

* Add support for code optimisation `CFLAGS' for near all unix platforms and
  compilers (using the qt-x11-free-3.1.1/mkspecs files info).

* Add support in `configure.ac' to $host

        i?86*-*-linux* | i386-*-solaris* | i?86-* | k?-* | athlon-*)

  to automatically manage cpu optimisation flags (gcc only).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.7.1pre1

* Bugfix: now `-l<int1>-<int2>' with <int2> less then <int1> gives an error
  message, not a segmentation fault!

* New `-w' option to permit an attack based on a given vocabulary.
  Basic features implemented.

* Add configuration options pair

        `--enable-shortpasswd'  /  `--disable-shortpasswd'

  to `configure.ac' to enable (default) or disable the optimisations
  in the code and force the program to use the original md5 algorithm.

* Add the `VERSION' used by the macro `m4_define' in `configure.ac'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
